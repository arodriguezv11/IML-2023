# Introduction to Machine Learning Course Projects

This repository contains the "Introduction to Machine Learning" course projects! This repository contains code and resources for the various machine learning projects I worked on as part of the course. The projects are designed to reinforce the concepts and techniques taught within the course and provide me with hands-on experience in solving real-world machine learning problems.

## Course Overview

In this course, I have learned the fundamental concepts and algorithms of machine learning, including supervised learning, unsupervised learning, and deep learning. I have gained hands-on experience with popular machine learning libraries like scikit-learn and Pytorch.
Each project is carefully designed to cover specific aspects of machine learning, allowing you to tackle various real-world scenarios. 

## Project Structure

Each project folder (e.g., `project1`, `project2`, etc.) contains a `data` directory where you will find the data and the Python code for implementing the machine learning algorithms and models.

## Getting Started

To get started with the course projects, you should have completed the prerequisite "Introduction to Machine Learning" course and have a basic understanding of Python programming and machine learning concepts. Ensure you have the necessary dependencies and libraries installed, which will be covered in the next section.

## Requirements

The projects in this repository require the following dependencies:

- Python (>= 3.6)
- Jupyter Notebook
- NumPy
- Pandas
- scikit-learn
- Pytorch (for deep learning projects)
- Matplotlib (for visualization)

I recommend setting up a virtual environment to manage these dependencies and avoid conflicts with other projects.
